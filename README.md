# Budget-calculator
A budget calculator to measure monthly expenses and incomes.

A simple application I've created for calculating monthly expenses. Currently it's not saving it's state in local storage (which means, if you refresh it's gone), but can be used as a calculator if you have invoices for instance after a month and you want to see the places your money has gone. üçøüçª
